[MESH DEFINITION]
# side lengths of inlet face (width, height)
x_side = 10.0
y_side = 10.0
# (optional) shape of inlet - if circular inlet, shortest side length will be used as diameter (default is square)
shape = circle
# (optional) define z length of domain if also generating the test meshed domain
z_side = 20.0
# number of mesh cells along each side
x_num_cells = 100
y_num_cells = 100
# (optional) define z mesh if also generating the test meshed domain
z_num_cells = 200

[VORTEX DEFINITIONS]
# vortex model [lo, solid, iso]
vortex_model = LO
# list of vortex data - for each vortex: (x-coord, y-coord, strength, core radius)
vortex1 = (0.0, 0.0, 0.5, 1.0)

[EXTRA]
# uniform axial (streamwise) velocity of inlet (default is 1)
axial_vel = 1.0

[MESH DEFINITION]
# Shape of inlet (circle, rect)
shape = circle

# (Only needed if circular inlet) radius of inlet face
radius = 0.5

# Number of mesh cells along each side - for circular domains, this is the mesh density of the square grid which contains the domain, with side length equal to domain diameter
x_num_cells = 1000
y_num_cells = 1000

# (Optional) define z length of domain if also generating the test meshed domain
z_side = 20.0
# (optional) define z mesh if also generating the test meshed domain
z_num_cells = 200

[VORTEX DEFINITIONS]
# Vortex model [lo, solid, iso]
vortex_model = LO
# List of vortex data - for each vortex: (x-coord, y-coord, strength, core radius)
vortex1 = (0.083, 0.0, 1.243, 0.250)
vortex2 = (-0.083, 0.0, -1.243, 0.250)

[EXTRA]
# Uniform axial (streamwise) velocity of inlet (default is 1)
axial_vel = 1.0
